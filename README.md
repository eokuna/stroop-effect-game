# Stroop Effect Game
CPE4750 Final Project

Introduction
------------
The Stroop effect is a psychological phenomenon in which, given text that has mismatched color and spelling and tasked with identifying the color of the text despite what the text spells, test subjects erroneously read the text rather than correctly report the color. Named after John Ridley Stroop, who first published the effect in English in 1935, the Stroop effect challenges players in their endeavor to return home.

Getting Started

How to Play
-----------
When the player first opens the app, a click-through introduction, elaborating the game's story plot, and tutorial will play. Afterwards, text on the left side of the screen will spell a color, which will not necessarily match the color of the text itself. The player must select the one of five total buttons presented on the right that spells the name of the color of the text. For example, the prompt text could spell "BLUE" in pink text, in which case the user would need to click the "PINK" button to continue playing.
