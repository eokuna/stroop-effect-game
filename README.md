WHAT IT IS/HOW IT WORKS *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

The Stroop Effect Game is an express node application game.
To run, enter the command
  node server.js
from the appropriate directory. The console will alert the user
that the application is running on port 3024. The server will handle
the GET requests, both by logging actions to the console and sending
interactive HTML files. The three possible GET requests are for the
game introduction, play, and win or lose outcomes.
*The HTTP POST is used to store player information (name, high score,
and date played) to the game's database.

HOW TO PLAY *----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

The Stroop Effect game is a fun way to experience the phenomena in
which people cannot help but to associate the spelling of a color with
the color itself. Elaborated more in the tutorial, gameplay requires
the player to select the correct button that best describes the color
of text presented on the left side of the screen rather than the color
spelled by it.
